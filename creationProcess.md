> I want to create an openai compatible API server with python and fastapi. I want to use openvino to generate the answer and reply back. write the specification and the detailed requirements to create this openvino-server
### Mistral
Creating an OpenAI-compatible API server using Python, FastAPI, and OpenVINO involves several steps and considerations. Below is a detailed specification and requirements list for building this server:

Specification
1. Project Overview
Name: OpenVINO-Server
Purpose: To create an API server that mimics the OpenAI API but uses OpenVINO for inference.
Technology Stack: Python, FastAPI, OpenVINO, Uvicorn (ASGI server)
2. Functional Requirements
API Endpoints:
```
/v1/chat/completions: Endpoint to generate text completions using OpenVINO models.
/v1/models: Endpoint to list available models.
/v1/health: Endpoint to check the health of the server.
```
Model Inference:

Use OpenVINO to load and run inference on models compatible with text generation tasks.

> API Endpoints "/v1/chat/completions" must accept compliant ChatML format messages, not only string
### Mistral reply

To ensure that the /v1/chat/completions endpoint accepts messages in the ChatML format, we need to update the specification to handle structured input. ChatML is a markup language designed for representing chat messages, which can include metadata, roles, and content.

Updated Specification for /v1/chat/completions Endpoint
1. Request Body
The request body should accept an array of messages in the ChatML format. Each message should include:

role: The role of the message sender (e.g., "user", "assistant", "system").
content: The content of the message.
Example Request Body:

Copy
{
  "model": "model_name",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello, how can you help me today?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I can assist with various tasks. What do you need help with?"
    }
  ],
  "max_tokens": 50,
  "temperature": 0.7
}
2. Response Body
The response body should also follow the ChatML format, including the generated message from the assistant.

Example Response Body:

Copy
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677652288,
  "model": "model_name",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Here is the information you requested."
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 15,
    "completion_tokens": 7,
    "total_tokens": 22
  }
}
Implementation Steps
Update the API Endpoint:

Modify the /v1/chat/completions endpoint to accept an array of messages in the request body.
Parse the messages and extract the content for processing.
Process ChatML Messages:

Implement logic to handle different roles (e.g., "user", "assistant", "system") and process the content accordingly.
Use the content from the messages to generate the response using the OpenVINO model.
Generate ChatML Response:

Format the generated response in the ChatML structure.
Include the role and content in the response message.
Test the Endpoint:

Write tests to ensure the endpoint correctly handles ChatML input and output.
Validate the response format and content.
By updating the endpoint to accept and respond with ChatML-formatted messages, you can ensure compatibility with structured chat data and improve the flexibility of the API.

> ok good. now please help me generate the python code for the server, and another one to test if it is working fine
### Mistral Le Chat


Let's create a basic implementation of the OpenVINO-Server using FastAPI and a simple test script to verify its functionality. This example will focus on setting up the API endpoints and handling ChatML-formatted messages.

OpenVINO-Server Implementation
First, ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

```python
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
main.py
Copy
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from datetime import datetime
import uuid

app = FastAPI()

# Define the message model
class Message(BaseModel):
    role: str
    content: str

# Define the request model
class ChatCompletionRequest(BaseModel):
    model: str
    messages: List[Message]
    max_tokens: int = 50
    temperature: float = 0.7

# Define the response model
class Choice(BaseModel):
    index: int
    message: Message
    finish_reason: str

class Usage(BaseModel):
    prompt_tokens: int
    completion_tokens: int
    total_tokens: int

class ChatCompletionResponse(BaseModel):
    id: str
    object: str = "chat.completion"
    created: int
    model: str
    choices: List[Choice]
    usage: Usage

# Mock function to simulate OpenVINO inference
def generate_completion(messages: List[Message], max_tokens: int, temperature: float) -> str:
    # In a real implementation, this function would use OpenVINO to generate a response
    return "This is a mock response from the assistant."

@app.post("/v1/chat/completions", response_model=ChatCompletionResponse)
async def chat_completions(request: ChatCompletionRequest):
    try:
        # Generate a response using the mock function
        response_content = generate_completion(request.messages, request.max_tokens, request.temperature)

        # Create the response object
        response = ChatCompletionResponse(
            id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            created=int(datetime.utcnow().timestamp()),
            model=request.model,
            choices=[
                Choice(
                    index=0,
                    message=Message(role="assistant", content=response_content),
                    finish_reason="stop"
                )
            ],
            usage=Usage(
                prompt_tokens=sum(len(msg.content.split()) for msg in request.messages),
                completion_tokens=len(response_content.split()),
                total_tokens=sum(len(msg.content.split()) for msg in request.messages) + len(response_content.split())
            )
        )
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@app.get("/v1/models")
async def list_models():
    # In a real implementation, this would return a list of available models
    return [{"id": "mock-model", "object": "model", "created": int(datetime.utcnow().timestamp()), "owned_by": "example-org"}]

@app.get("/v1/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

# Run the server with: uvicorn main:app --reload
Test Script
test_server.py
```python
import requests

BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"

def test_chat_completions():
    url = f"{BASE_URL}/v1/chat/completions"
    payload = {
        "model": "mock-model",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can you help me today?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "I can assist with various tasks. What do you need help with?"}
        ],
        "max_tokens": 50,
        "temperature": 0.7
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "choices" in data
    assert data["choices"][0]["message"]["role"] == "assistant"
    print("test_chat_completions passed!")

def test_list_models():
    url = f"{BASE_URL}/v1/models"
    response = requests.get(url)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert len(data) > 0
    print("test_list_models passed!")

def test_health_check():
    url = f"{BASE_URL}/v1/health"
    response = requests.get(url)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert data["status"] == "ok"
    print("test_health_check passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_chat_completions()
    test_list_models()
    test_health_check()
```

Running the Server and Tests
Start the Server:

Run the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Run the Tests:

Execute the test script to verify the API endpoints:
```
python test_server.py
```
This setup provides a basic structure for the OpenVINO-Server with FastAPI and includes a test script to ensure the endpoints are functioning correctly. You can expand upon this by integrating actual OpenVINO models and enhancing the functionality as needed.
